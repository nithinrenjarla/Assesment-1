# 1. Sequence Detector Design
The sequence detector was designed using Verilog HDL based on a finite state machine (FSM) approach.

# Design Files
```verilog/
sequence_detector.v
tb.v
synthesized.v
```
# 2. RTL Simulation
The RTL design was simulated using Icarus Verilog to verify the functional behavior of the sequence detector.

The simulation output was observed for different input sequences and the detected output was verified.

# 3. Waveform Analysis
The generated VCD file was opened using GTKWave to analyze the simulation waveforms.

# 4. RTL Synthesis
The RTL design was synthesized using Yosys.

The synthesized design was successfully converted into a gate-level representation, and synthesis statistics were obtained.

# 7. Gate-Level Simulation
Gate-Level Simulation (GLS) was performed using the synthesized netlist.

The GLS waveform was analyzed using GTKWave to verify the behavior of the synthesized design.

# 6. RTL vs GLS Comparison
The RTL and GLS waveforms were compared to verify that the synthesized design maintains the expected functional behavior.
